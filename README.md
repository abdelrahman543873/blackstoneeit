## Description

## Installation

```bash
$ yarn
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ yarn start

# running the tests
$ yarn test

```

## the app has a full swagger documentation of the api at localhost:3000/api
### start the server and go to the documentation url
### also the app has the erd in the erd.dio file in the project

## notes

nestjs framework was chosen here to allow for easier documentation of the api using , swagger ui and nestjs/swagger i am able to document the whole api using decorators which is amazing , also all the tests are run in the memory and won't affect your local environment because of the mongodb in memory server , but when you first run the tests of the app allow for extra time for the in memory mongodb server to download
